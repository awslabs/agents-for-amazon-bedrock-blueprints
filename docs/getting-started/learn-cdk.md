# Learn about AWS CDK with TypeScript

[AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html){:target="_blank"} with TypeScript enables developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming concepts. It provides a high-level object-oriented framework for defining AWS resources as code. With AWS CDK, you can leverage TypeScript's strong typing and modern language features to create, compose, and reuse cloud components. This approach simplifies infrastructure management, improves code reusability, and enhances development productivity.
